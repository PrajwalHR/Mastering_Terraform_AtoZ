# To start a terform file

```
terraform apply
or 
terraform distroy 
```
```
terraform init

For a dry run : terraform plan [ just like what if? in ansible ]
```
```
terraform apply --auto-approve
 or
terraform distroy --auto-approve
```
# NOTE

Terraform does not depend on the postion of calling out the task
